#Orion, Guardian of the Galaxy#

The game was created in Unity, using C# and Python for hand gesture recognition.

The story focuses on a brave plush bear named Orion, who navigates through an enchanted forest. During his journey, Orion discovers a mysterious coded message. Shortly after discovering the message, Vega appears and explains to Orion that this message holds the key to combating a malevolent extraterrestrial entity known as the Shadow, along with its spectral followers, the ghosts.
